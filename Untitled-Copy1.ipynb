    "AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It encompasses Narrow AI, which focuses on specific tasks, and General AI, which possesses human-like intelligence. AI utilizes rule-based systems or Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques to learn from data and improve performance. For example, a chatbot that uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to understand and respond to user queries is an application of AI."
